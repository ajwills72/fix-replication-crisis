# fix-replication-crisis

Slides for a talk I gave at the Plymouth University School of Psychology Resarch Seminar Series, on 13 Feb 2019. It's an opinionated survey of seven causes of the replication crisis in psychology, and a practical how-to guide for avoiding these causes in your own reserch. It's aimed at a broad audience of psychology professionals, starting around final-year psychology undergraduate student and going through to mid-career academic.

## Source code

These slides were produced using the `rmarkdown` pacakge of `R`. If you use _RStudio_, start a new Version Control project, and use the _git_ option to download the files. Then open the `.Rmd` file, and click _knit_.  

If you use R outside of RStudio (e.g. you use Emacs), the file `render.R` contains the commands you need to knit the file.
